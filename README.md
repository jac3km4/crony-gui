## C.R.O.N.Y GUI
Small WIP scripting framework for Elex 2

### synopsis
This project provides a way to extend Elex 2 with custom scripts.
It exposes a [library of functions](https://github.com/jac3km4/crony-gui/tree/master/doc/FUNCTIONS.md) that can be used to various things in the game (looting containers, adding followers etc).
The scripting runtime is backed by a programming language called [Rhai](https://rhai.rs).
There's also graphical console available, it can be toggled with the Home key and used to run scripts while you're playing.
